# Server Mods List



You can ignore the rest of the folders. You only need the Mods folder to see what mods are on the server. It's literally just all the mods so you can download it from here too if you need a specific version or can't find a mod. Mostly just so I can push commits to the Discord.



To download them (for idiots like DarkKiller), go to the Releases section thingy on the right and download the latest one :D
